PROJECT NAME: TABLES & CHARTS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

BACKGROUND OF THE ORGANIZATION

Founded in 1993, Independent University, Bangladesh is one of the oldest private universities in Bangladesh where academic excellence is a tradition, teaching a passion and lifelong learning a habit. IUB currently has more than 7,048 undergraduate and graduate students and over 10,455 alumni. The student population is projected to grow at 10% annually. The students of IUB experience an exciting academic life with copious opportunities to explore and nurture their innate talent.
IUB uses smart and new techniques of education which are robust and is committed to produce graduates who will be equipped to provide new leadership through skilled employment.

BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT

The goal of this project is to create a web-based system that will enable a university to make meaningful analysis of its resources and revenue in the form of tables and graphs. The system will have the capability to calculate IUB classroom requirements as per course offering, enrolment-wise course distribution among the schools, revenue, and much more. 
It will provide a range of tools intended to help universities and other stakeholders to evaluate its resources and revenue and provide strategies for improvements.


OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT

The main purpose of creating this system is to reduce the amount of work and make the work more orderly. The university has a lot of work that takes a lot of time to do, like if we want to see how many classrooms the university has, how many have been enrolled in different departments and how much money the university has been able to generate revenue and the difference in departmental revenue. This kind of work requires a lot of time and a lot of calculations but the system we are building will show all this information in the form of tables and charts in a few moments so that it will take a lot of time and make the work much easier. Will be done.

SCOPE OF THE PROJECT

In the existing system all the data that is required for making meaningful analysis of concerns such as Resource Usage or Classroom Requirements among other topics for each semester is done manually. For each type of data employees have to tediously reach out to different offices and departments and then use those data to make necessary calculations by hand.All this inconvenience can be avoided by implementing a centralized database from which all the required data can be downloaded at once in the form of tally sheets. The tally sheets can then be uploaded into a system that can extract all the data from it and make required calculations using those data to automatically generate meaningful tables and graphs as per user requirements.
